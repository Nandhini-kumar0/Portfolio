                <h3>Salt Impurity Detection</h3>
                <p>The quality and purity of salt are crucial for its applications in the food, health, and industrial sectors. Contaminants such as dust, sand, algae, metals, and stones can significantly impact the usability and safety of salt. To address this, the project aims to develop a machine learning-based impurity detection system that utilizes computer vision techniques to automate the analysis of salt samples.Users can upload images of salt samples to the system, which processes these images using a deep learning model trained on a carefully labeled dataset. The system identifies and categorizes specific impurities and quantifies their presence by calculating the percentage composition of contaminants. The output provides detailed insights into the types and levels of impurities, ensuring better quality control and resource optimization.</p>

                <h3>Smart Waste Management</h3>
                <p>This project, developed for a hackathon, focuses on creating a real-time waste monitoring and segregation solution. Using sensors and IoT devices, it tracks the fill levels of waste bins and segregates waste into categories like organic, recyclable, and non-recyclable. The system displays the data on a web interface through bar charts, enabling efficient waste collection and resource management. The goal is to promote sustainability, reduce landfills, and optimize waste handling.</p>
